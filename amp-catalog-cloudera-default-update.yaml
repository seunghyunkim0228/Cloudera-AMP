  - title: Churn Modeling with scikit-learn
    label: churn-prediction
    short_description: Build an scikit-learn model to predict churn using customer telco data.
    long_description: >-
      This project demonstrates how to build a logistic regression classification model to predict the probability 
      that a group of customers will churn from a fictitious telecommunications company. In addition, the model is 
      interpreted using a technique called Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations (LIME). Both the logistic 
      regression and LIME models are deployed using CML's real-time model deployment capability and interact with a 
      basic Flask-based web application.
