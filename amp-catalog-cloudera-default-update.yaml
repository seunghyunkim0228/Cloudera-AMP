    short_description: Applying a structural time series approach to California hourly electricity demand data.
    long_description: >-
      This project provides an example application of a structural approach to time series via 
      generalized additive models (with the Prophet library) to California hourly electricity demand 
      data. The primary output of this repository is a small application exposing a probablistic 
      forecast and interface for asking a probabilistic questions against it.

  - title: Explaining Models with LIME and SHAP
    label: Explainability_LIME_SHAP
    short_description: LIME and SHAP. We discuss how these two algorithms work, and show some code examples of how to implement them in Python.
    long_description: >-
      At Cloudera Fast Forward, we see model interpretability as an important step in the data science workflow. Being able to explain how a model works serves many purposes, including building trust in the model's output, satisfying regulatory requirements, model debugging, and verifying model safety, amongst other things. We have written a research report (access it free here) that discusses this topic in detail.
