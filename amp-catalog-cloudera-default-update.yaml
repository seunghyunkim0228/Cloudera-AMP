    short_description: Applying a structural time series approach to California hourly electricity demand data.
    long_description: >-
      This project provides an example application of a structural approach to time series via 
      generalized additive models (with the Prophet library) to California hourly electricity demand 
      data. The primary output of this repository is a small application exposing a probablistic 
      forecast and interface for asking a probabilistic questions against it.
